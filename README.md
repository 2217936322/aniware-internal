## Issues
- Features not fully implemented
- Very incomplete; bare bones at this stage.

If you would like to commit a change or otherwise fix that might help the project, go ahead.
Naturally, please follow the general style which is pursued and is consistent throughout.

## FAQ

### What do you plan on adding in the future?
Hopefully I will be able to push this project forward and develop a fully featured cheat. I am drawing a lot of inspiration from the late AimTux project which I still think is the most complete & whole cheat ever developed for csgo.
